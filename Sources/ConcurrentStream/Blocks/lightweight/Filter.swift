    /// The overhead of this method is kept minimum. It would perform the same as `Sequence.filter(_:)`.
    ///
    /// > Example:
    /// >
    /// > ```swift
    /// > [1, 2, 3, 1].stream.filter(\.isEven) // [2]
    /// > ```

    /// - Returns: The stream all of whose elements match `isIncluded`.

    /// - Important: There is **no way** to retrieve the discarded elements. A stream is not copyable. (Although in this implementation, it is copy-by-reference.)
    ///
    /// - Complexity: This method does not involve the creation of a new `taskGroup`.

    /// ### Variants
    /// These variants are implementation details, which are employed to ensure the proper throwing.
