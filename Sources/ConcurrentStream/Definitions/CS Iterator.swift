/// An iterator to a concurrent stream.
///
/// This protocol is a class protocol, due to the fact that
/// - A class protocol has a `deinit` block, where the task can be cancelled.
/// - A class protocol has non-mutating next, making the following way of cancelation possible:
/// ```swift
/// let iterator = await ConcurrentStreamOrderedIterator(stream: stream)
///
/// try await withTaskCancellationHandler {
///     for _ in 0...1000 {
///         heavyWork(i: 0)
///     }
///
///     while let next = try await iterator.next() {
///         ...
///     }
/// } onCancel: {
///     iterator.cancel()
/// }
/// ```

    ///

    ///
    /// - throws: rethrows whatever is thrown in the definition.
