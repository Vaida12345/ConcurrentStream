    /// try await (1...1000)
    ///     .stream
    ///     .enumerate { index, value in
    ///         
    ///     }
    /// ```

    /// To cancel the task of iterator, call ``ConcurrentStreamIterator/cancel()``.

    /// - Important: When using a `Task { }` to obtain `next`, remember to mark the priority of the `Task` above `.medium`, otherwise the system would try to complete the iterator before entering the task.
