    /// - Automatically cancelled when the parent `Task` executing  ``ConcurrentStream/ConcurrentStream/next()`` is cancelled.
    /// - Calling ``ConcurrentStream/ConcurrentStream/cancel()`` explicitly.
    ///
    /// This should cover the common use case. You can read details about the `ConcurrentStream` [here](<doc:Principle>).

    /// > Example:
    /// > You could use the `withTaskCancellationHandler` to observe the cancelation of parent task,
    /// >
    /// > ```swift
    /// > let stream = some ConcurrentStream
    /// >
    /// > try await withTaskCancellationHandler {
    /// >     ...
    /// >     stream.foo()
    /// > } onCancel: {
    /// >     iterator.cancel()
    /// > }
